# TestRepo3-3

> [!NOTE]
> What is this template repository about and how to use it:
>
> * For codeowners of existing CAMARA repository it is a sample how a CAMARA repository should look like, e.g. to update legacy repositories. Have a look specifically on the [code of the README.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/Template_API_Repository/blob/main/README.md?plain=1) for different variants and copy relevant parts into your repository.
> * For CAMARA admins to create new (Sandbox) API repositories automated: Use the `setup-new-repo` workflow together with documentation in [templates/README.md](templates/README.md).
>
> The following is the template README for a new independent Sandbox repositories, Sandbox repositories within a Sub Project, and Incubated Repositories. Further variants are within the commented code.
>
> This note must be deleted in newly created repositories
